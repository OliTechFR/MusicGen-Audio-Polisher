# MusicGen-Audio-Polisher

Enhance MusicGen-generated audio by reducing noise and artifacts while improving fidelity. Generate and save spectrograms, including side-by-side comparisons of raw vs restored audio. Display or save visualizations while keeping the workflow flexible and reproducible.

## Introduction

This project provides a pipeline to enhance audio generated by MusicGen, focusing on noise reduction, artifact removal, and overall fidelity improvement. It leverages Jupyter notebooks for a flexible and reproducible workflow, allowing users to visualize the audio restoration process through spectrograms and other visualizations.

## Features

-   **Audio Enhancement:** Reduces noise and artifacts in MusicGen-generated audio.
-   **Fidelity Improvement:** Enhances the overall audio quality.
-   **Spectrogram Generation:** Creates spectrograms for both raw and restored audio, enabling visual comparison.
-   **Visualization:** Displays or saves visualizations to analyze the audio restoration process.
-   **Flexible Workflow:** Uses Jupyter notebooks for easy customization and experimentation.
-   **Reproducibility:** Ensures consistent results through a well-defined pipeline.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   [Python](https://www.python.org/) (>=3.7)
-   [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)
-   Required Python packages (see `1_Pipeline.ipynb` for details)

## Usage

### Pipeline Overview

The project consists of two main Jupyter notebooks:

-   **`0_Generator.ipynb`**: This notebook handles the initial audio generation using MusicGen. *Note: Since this project focuses on polishing, ensure you have your MusicGen-generated audio ready, or modify this notebook accordingly.*
-   **`1_Pipeline.ipynb`**: This notebook contains the core audio polishing pipeline. It loads the raw audio, applies noise reduction and enhancement techniques, generates spectrograms, and saves the restored audio.

### Notebooks

1.  **`0_Generator.ipynb`**:

    -   Run the notebook to generate the raw audio files.

2.  **`1_Pipeline.ipynb`**:

    -   Open the `1_Pipeline.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter:

        ```bash
        jupyter notebook 1_Pipeline.ipynb
        ```

    -   Modify the notebook to point to the correct input audio files (generated by MusicGen or any other source).
    -   Adjust the audio processing parameters (noise reduction, enhancement levels, etc.) as needed.
    -   Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the audio polishing pipeline.
    -   Examine the generated spectrograms and visualizations to evaluate the results.
    -   The restored audio files will be saved in the `restored_outputs` directory.

## Outputs and Visualizations

The pipeline generates the following outputs:

-   **`outputs`**: Contains the initial MusicGen-generated audio files.
-   **`restored_outputs`**: Contains the enhanced audio files after processing.
-   **`spectrograms`**: Contains spectrogram images of both raw and restored audio, allowing for visual comparison.
-   **`plots`**: May contain other visualizations generated during the audio processing pipeline.
